# Exploring the nuance behind Tree Equity Score
## Sam Marshall

This Earth Engine App was created as an offshoot of an earlier effort to reproduce the Tree Equity Score analysis of urban tree cover. [Tree Equity Score](https://treeequityscore.org/) is a project created by the nonprofit American Forests that aims to determine the relative need for tree planting in each neighborhood in every city in the U.S. 
It has many strengths, but lacks nuance. This app examines the complex relationships between four of the components of Tree Equity Score (canopy cover, temperature, nonwhite population, and low income population) in New York City.
